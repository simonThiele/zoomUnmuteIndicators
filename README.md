# Zoom Unmute Indicators

## But why?

Everybody using zoom frequently knows the issue: You say something and forget to mute yourself, sometimes leaking funny information to your collegues.
You just need a bigger indication, that you are not muted!

## How does it work?

This is a simple MacOS app build in swift that runs in the background. To check if zoom is on mute or not, a JXA script is fired, checking, if the zoom window is muted or not. There are two different ways to indicate the mute status:

1. **Menu bar icon**: The menu bar icon changes color depending on the mute status. It is a simple red dot, that turns red when unmuted.
2. **Window border**: The window border of the zoom window changes color depending on the mute status. It is a simple red gradient when unmuted.

## Installation

### Build the swift app

```bash
mkdir -p ./build
```

```bash
swiftc -framework Cocoa -o ./build/App main.swift App.swift BorderController.swift MenuBarMutable.swift WindowBorderMutable.swift
```

### Run the swift app manually

```bash
./build/App --withMenuBarIndicator --withWindowBorderIndicator
```

#### Arguments

- `--withMenuBarIndicator`: Show the menu bar indicator
- `--withWindowBorderIndicator`: Show the window border indicator
- `--unmuteButtonText="Audio stummschalten"`: Set the text of the unmute button (default: ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ("Mute audio"))

Feel free to automate the startup
